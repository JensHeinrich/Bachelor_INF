	abstract = {The overwhelming majority of a software systems lifespan is spent in use, not in design or implementation. So, why does conventional wisdom insist that software engineers focus primarily on the design and development of large-scale computing systems? In this collection of essays and articles, key members of Googles Site Reliability Team explain how and why their commitment to the entire lifecycle has enabled the company to successfully build, deploy, monitor, and maintain some of the largest software systems in the world. Youll learn the principles and practices that enable Google engineers to make systems more scalable, reliable, and efficientlessons directly applicable to your organization. This book is divided into four sections: Introduction Learn what site reliability engineering is and why it differs from conventional IT industry practices Principles Examine the patterns, behaviors, and areas of concern that influence the work of a site reliability engineer (SRE) Practices Understand the theory and practice of an SREs day-to-day work: building and operating large distributed computing systems Management Explore Google's best practices for training, communication, and meetings that your organization can use},

	year = {1999},
	__markedentry = {[jens:6]},
	abstract = {A software architecture determines how system components are identified and allocated, how the components interact to form a system, the amount and granularity of communication needed for interaction, and the interface protocols used for communication. For a network-based application, system performance is dominated by network communication. Therefore, selection of the appropriate architectural style(s) for use in designing the software architecture can make the difference between success and failure in the deployment of a network-based application. Software architectural styles have been characterized by their control-flow and dataflow patterns, allocation of functionality across components, and component types. Unfortunately, none of these characterizations are useful for understanding how a style influences the set of architectural properties, or qualities, of a system. These properties include, among others, user-perceived performance, network efficiency, simplicity, modifiability, scalability, and portability.We use these style-induced architectural properties to classify styles for network-based applications with the goal of understanding why certain styles are better than others for some applications, thus providing additional guidance for software engineers faced with the task of architectural design.},

	__markedentry = {[jens:6]},
	abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The modern Web architecture emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. In this paper, we introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, developed as an abstract model of the Web architecture to guide our redesign and definition of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifiers. We describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. We then compare the abstract model to the currently deployed Web architecture in order to elicit mismatches between the existing protocols and the applications they are intended to support.},

The edit operations investigated allow changing one symbol of a string into another single symbol, deleting one symbol from a string, or inserting a single symbol into a string. An algorithm is presented which solves this problem in time proportional to the product of the lengths of the two strings. Possible applications are to the problems of automatic spelling correction and determining the longest subsequence of characters common to two strings.},

@article{maslow1943:motivation,
	author = {Maslow, A.H.},
	abstract = {After listing the propositions that must be considered as basic, the author formulates a theory of human motivation in line with these propositions and with the known facts derived from observation and experiment. There are 5 sets of goals (basic needs) which are related to each other and are arranged in a hierarchy of prepotency. When the most prepotent goal is realized, the next higher need emerges. "Thus man is a perpetually wanting animal." Thwarting, actual or imminent, of these basic needs provides a psychological threat that leads to psychopathy.
