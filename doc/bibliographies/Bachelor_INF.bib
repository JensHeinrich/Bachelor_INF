    abstract = "In this paper, we present the development of a training dataset for Dutch Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the archaeology domain. This dataset was created as there is a dire need for semantic search within archaeology, in order to allow archaeologists to find structured information in collections of Dutch excavation reports, currently totalling around 60,000 (658 million words) and growing rapidly. To guide this search task, NER is needed. We created rigorous annotation guidelines in an iterative process, then instructed five archaeology students to annotate a number of documents. The resulting dataset contains {\textasciitilde}31k annotations between six entity types (artefact, time period, place, context, species {\&} material). The inter-annotator agreement is 0.95, and when we used this data for machine learning, we observed an increase in F1 score from 0.51 to 0.70 in comparison to a machine learning model trained on a dataset created in prior work. This indicates that the data is of high quality, and can confidently be used to train NER classifiers.",

abstract = {Traditional isolated monolingual name taggers tend to yield inconsistent results across two languages. In this paper, we propose two novel approaches to jointly and consistently extract names from parallel corpora. The first approach uses standard linear-chain Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) as the learning framework, incorporating cross-lingual features propagated between two languages. The second approach is based on a joint CRFs model to jointly decode sentence pairs, incorporating bilingual factors based on word alignment. Experiments on Chinese-English parallel corpora demonstrated that the proposed methods significantly outperformed monolingual name taggers, were robust to automatic alignment noise and achieved state-of-the-art performance. With only 20\%of the training data, our proposed methods can already achieve better performance compared to the baseline learned from the whole training set.1},
